    <p>A playlist is a collection of related videos or other media assets (i.e. seasons, live events, etc) that are grouped together in a particular order for playback in a player. The Media module makes it easy to create playlists and add assets to a playlist. After playlists have been created, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add playlists to pages used in {{ site.product_short }} apps - <span class="BCL-objective">For information, see <a href="/layout/managing-playlists-on-pages.html">Managing Playlists on Pages</a></span></li>
      <li>Publish a playlist to a player to display on a web page - <span class="BCL-objective">For information, see <a href="/publish/publishing-videos-and-playlists-media-module.html">Publishing Videos and Playlists with the Media Module</a></span></li>
    </ul>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="types">Types of playlists</h2>
    <p>There are two types of playlists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual</strong> - With a manual playlist, you assign specific videos or media assets to the playlist and re-order them manually</li>
      <li><strong>Smart</strong> - With a smart playlist, the videos or media assets in the playlist are constructed automatically, based on  tags or other metadata associated with the asset. Smart playlists are dynamic and automatically update based upon the assets in your media library and the rules that define the playlist.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are Video Cloud and OTT variations of both playlist types.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Video Cloud playlists</strong> - Can <strong>only</strong> contain videos</li>
      <li> <strong>OTT playlists</strong> - Can contain videos and other entities (i.e. live events, series, seasons, etc.). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Brightcove recommends that playlists that contain only videos be created as Video Cloud playlists even though OTT playlists can contain only videos. There is no limit to the number of playlists that can be created. The assets that are initially loaded into a playlist in the player is determined by the type of playlist:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual </strong> - Assets are loaded into the playlist based upon the order of the items in the  playlist</li>
      <li><strong>Smart </strong> - Assets are loaded into the playlist based upon the <strong>Play Order</strong> playlist setting </li>
    </ul>
