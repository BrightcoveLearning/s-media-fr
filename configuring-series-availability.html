    <p>The availability settings are controlled using rule sets. All series must have at least one rule set. Rule sets are created to control access to a series based upon:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start/end dates</li>
      <li>Devices</li>
      <li>Locations</li>
      <li>Monetization</li>
    </ul>
